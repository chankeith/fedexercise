# Photo frontend development exercise - Image Viewer

### Task
Build a browser based web application that fetches images and then displays those images from a publicly available API - either the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://metmuseum.github.io/) or [Nasa's account via the Flickr API](https://github.com/ibmfrontend/fedexercise/blob/master/API_DETAILS.md).  You should use the technology that is expected from the position you are applying for and it's corresponding components from the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/react/).  Include some basic test automation.

**This example design is in no way prescriptive on how the app must look.**

### Criteria
 - Implementation of basic functionality - viewing images from an API
 - Choice of design, layout and intuitiveness of the interface
 - Other reasonable features you think should be present in an image viewing application
 - Page load times and performance
 - Use of source control to organize and store code
 - Test automation, including choice of test cases

### Submission Requirements
Preferably send us a link to your repository with your implementation, otherwise, email it to us.  In either case, we must be able to view your source code and be able to run it. 

### Questions?
If there's anything that's unclear or if you just have a general question, we're just an email away! :)
